# Multiple Upstream Permission System

MUPS is an extensible format and standard, originally developed by [Doorpass](https://doorpass.io), which constitutes a way to manage permissions for SASS based products.

## Target Audience

This repository is primarily targeted at both individuals or business interested in implementing MUPS as part of or their entire permissions model.

We also welcome contributions from any member of the community who might wish to improve or add to the specification. Further information on this is available in the [Contributions](#contributions) section.

## Repository Structure

This repository does not contain any implementation of MUPS. A reference implementation of MUPS written in JavaScript can be found [here](https://github.com/doorpass/node-mups).

The standard is set out into two logical sections:

**Specification.md**
This file defines the standard itself and the available tags and formats of the standard.

**Examples**
This directory contains some examples of MUPS files so that you can see various use cases of the standard.

## Contributing

Do you have an idea or suggestion on how we can improve the MUPS standard? We'd love to hear it!

We have three simple steps for suggesting updates to the standard:

1. Create an issue on GitHub detailing your suggestion, the benefits of making it and any potential issues you see in terms of backward compatibility or logical breaks. You should seek to gain some backing from the community and show that this change is something that is at worst not harmful to anyone and at best useful to everyone.

2. Create a Pull Request with your proposed modifications to the standard.

3. Submit your Pull Request then have it reviewed / merged by a project moderator!

## Thanks and Attribution

**Doorpass.io**
Founded the project and contributed the original time and effort required to start the specification. They also continue to maintain the format.

[Doorpass](https://doorpass.io) is the leading provider of centralized team management for cloud services. They developed MUPS to provide a unified way that SASS products can share and expose the permissions available to the platform in a easy to parse and sensible way.
